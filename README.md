# MLAI2024-Banking-Campaign

In this third practical application assignment, your goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines) you encountered in this section of the program. You will use a dataset related to the marketing of bank products over the telephone.

### Business Objective

The goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on features from a direct marketing campaign dataset. The predictions should help the bank better target potential customers, increasing the efficiency of marketing efforts and improving customer acquisition rates.
